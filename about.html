      <p id='intro'> I'm a veggie farmer turned tech nerd!  There are surprising similarities between farming
        and building programs, not the least of which is a constant vigilance for bugs!<br><br>

        I started a farm with my friend and then had the opportunity to spend a year working in Antarctica. After 
        that amazing experience I came back home to Austin.  I realized I wanted to have the tools to make a bigger
        impact on the world around me and learning to build things with computers seemed like just the tool.  I love how 
        challenging and satisfying it has been so far and look forward to the many years of learning and building ahead.<br><br>

        When I'm not in front of my computer I like to see live music, cook the food from my garden, 
        hike with my dogs, ride my bicycle around Austin and play by the river.  I think Austin is an amazing place!
